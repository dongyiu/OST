===== OPTIMAL STOPPING THEORY EXPLANATION =====

The job search optimizer uses Optimal Stopping Theory (OST) to determine when to accept a job offer:

1. DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH:
   - The algorithm works backwards from the end of the search period
   - For each week, it calculates a "threshold utility" - the minimum value an offer needs to be accepted
   - These thresholds decrease over time as your options narrow and financial pressure increases

2. UTILITY CALCULATION:
   - Each job offer gets a utility score based on your preferences
   - Salary, career growth, work-life balance, etc. are weighted according to your priorities
   - The higher the utility score, the better the overall job offer

3. DECISION RULE:
   - Accept the first offer that exceeds your current threshold
   - Early in the search: Be selective, only accept exceptional offers
   - Middle of search: Become gradually less selective
   - Near end of financial runway: Accept more marginal offers to avoid financial distress

4. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING DECISIONS:
   - Financial runway: How long can you afford to search?
   - Job search urgency: How quickly do you need a new job?
   - Risk tolerance: How willing are you to wait for better offers?
   - Preference weights: What job factors matter most to you?

The simulation runs through the entire search period, making realistic decisions at each point based on
the available information. This mirrors the real-world challenge of job searching where you must decide
whether to accept an offer or keep looking, without knowing what future offers might come.
